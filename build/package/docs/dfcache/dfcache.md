% DFCACHE(1) Version v2.1.0 | Frivolous "Dfcache" Documentation

# NAME

**dfcache** â€” the P2P cache client of dragonfly

# SYNOPSIS

dfcache is the cache client to of dragonfly that communicates with dfdaemon and operates
on files in P2P network, where the P2P network acts as a cache system.

The difference between dfcache and dfget is that, dfget downloads file from a given URL,
the file might be on other peers in P2P network or a seed peer, it's the P2P network's
responsibility to download file from source; but dfcache could only export or download a
file that has been imported or added into P2P network by other peer, it's the user's
responsibility to go back to source and add file into P2P network.
