.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dfget is the client of Dragonfly which takes a role of peer in a P2P
network.
When user triggers a file downloading task, dfget will download the
pieces of file from other peers.
Meanwhile, it will act as an uploader to support other peers to download
pieces from it if it owns them.
In addition, dfget has the abilities to provide more advanced
functionality, such as network bandwidth limit, transmission encryption
and so on.
