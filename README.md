Provide efficient, stable and secure file distribution and image acceleration
based on p2p technology to be the best practice and
standard solution in cloud native architectures.

## Introduction

Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and
image acceleration system. It is hosted by the
Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://cncf.io/)) as
an Incubating Level Project.
Its goal is to tackle all distribution problems in cloud native architectures.
Currently Dragonfly focuses on being:

- **Simple**: Well-defined user-facing API (HTTP), non-invasive to all container engines;
- **Efficient**: Seed peer support, P2P based file distribution to save enterprise bandwidth;
- **Intelligent**: Host-level speed limit, intelligent flow control due to host detection;
- **Secure**: Block transmission encryption, HTTPS connection support.

## Architecture

![alt][arch]

**Manager:** Maintain the relationship between each P2P cluster, dynamic configuration management and RBAC.
It also includes a front-end console, which is convenient for users to visually operate the cluster.

**Scheduler:** Select the optimal download parent peer for the download peer. Exceptions control Dfdaemon's back-to-source.

**Seed Peer**: Dfdaemon turns on the Seed Peer mode can be used as
a back-to-source download peer in a P2P cluster,
which is the root peer for download in the entire cluster.

**Peer**: Deploy with dfdaemon, based on the C/S architecture, it provides the `dfget` command download tool,
and the `dfget daemon` running daemon to provide task download capabilities.
